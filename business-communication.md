# Business Communication

## 📁 Evidence
As part of my work readiness training, I developed a professional presentation and written report simulating a business scenario.  
This included drafting a formal email to a project supervisor, presenting findings to a small audience, and designing presentation slides using Figma. In addition to formal presentations, I developed a product concept called **UniConnect**, which required clear communication of technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders.  
This experience strengthened my ability to translate complex software concepts into engaging and understandable presentations.
